F2F - Fling 2 Find out! Here you can find [My Portal 2 map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3269933606)'s VMF as well as the assets used.

> **_NOTE:_** You may need [Teamspen's Hammer Addons](https://github.com/TeamSpen210/HammerAddons) to compile this map as they were used for some features.

To use the custom sounds, paste the directories into the `<steamroot>/Portal 2/` directory. List of those assets:

`materials/nature/toxicslime_movingplane` - used for the top face of toxic slime. This is a modified version of `nature/toxicslime002a` compatible with the `func_water_analog` entity.

`materials/nature/toxicslime_movingplane_beneath` - an analog for `toxicslime_movingplane`, seen on the top face from below.

`materials/nature/toxicslime_movingsolid` - a modified version of `toxicslime_movingplane` but compiled as a solid material rather than water.

`sound/anonymus/anonymus.wav` - an easter egg sound taken from a meme. To hear it in-game you have to turn on the radio.

`sound/disc/disc_create.wav` - the sound that's played when a disc is spawned, the exact same as the charging sound of a portal gun on a pedestal from Portal.

`sound/test/stage1.wav` - music played when the player opens the first door. A cut off loop of Die Cut Laser Dance.

`sound/test/stage2.wav` - intro played after the player enters the big collapsing room, before `stage2.1.wav`. A cut off intro of Vitrification Order that fades in.

`sound/test/stage2.1.wav` - a cut off loop of Vitrification Order. Plays right after `stage2.wav`.

`sound/test/stage3.wav` - An Accent Beyond, played after the player presses the button in a locked area behind a secret panel with a cube. Tells them to escape the rising goo.

`sound/test/stage4.wav` - A cut off loop of Bots Build Bots, played when the player drains the toxic goo.
